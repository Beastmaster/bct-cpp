Creating a New Function
-----------------------
1. Create function_name.cpp:
Write the function in its own .cpp file.  Use the original BCT function name as
both the filename and the function name.  Make sure to define the function in
the bct namespace.

2. Update bct.h:
Add the function prototype for function_name to the bct namespace.

3. Update Makefile:
Add function_name.o to the list of objects.

4. Create test/function_name_cpp.cpp:
Write an Octave wrapper function in its own .cpp file.  The two macros defined
in test/bct_test.h should make this easy.  If the function calculates a scalar
quantity, use the MATRIX_TO_SCALAR_FUNCTION macro.  If it calculates a vector or
matrix (Octave doesn't care which), use the MATRIX_TO_MATRIX_FUNCTION macro.
These macros convert an Octave matrix to a GSL matrix, pass it to the C++
function in question, and convert the result back into Octave format.  Some
error checking is done to ensure we don't crash Octave if something goes wrong.
Just write 'MATRIX_TO_X_FUNCTION(function_name)', and the macros take care of
the rest.

5. Update test/bct_test_all.m:
Now that the C++ function is callable from Octave, add a test to compare the
outputs of the original BCT function and the C++ version.  In general, this
involves looping through the five cortical connectivity data sets and comparing
the results of calls to function_name (original version) and function_name_cpp
(C++ version).  Details, however, may vary from function to function.

6. Update test/Makefile:
Add function_name_cpp to the list of filenames.

Running the Regression Test Suite
---------------------------------
1. Install the BCT C++ library.
Run 'make install' to compile and install libbct.a.  The library is placed in
/usr/local/lib, while the header file is placed in /usr/local/include.

2. Install the regression test suite.
In the test directory, run 'make install' to compile oct-files and install them
(along with the supporting .m files) in /usr/local/share/bct.  mkoctfile (the
Octave executable) must be in your shell's path for this to work.

3. Run the suite.
Start Octave and execute 'bct_test_all'.  The regression test suite (located at
/usr/local/share/bct) and the original BCT .m files must be in your Octave path
for this to work.  See the Octave documentation for the path, addpath, and
savepath commands.
